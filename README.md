# Emacs Local

This is a local config for use with [`ocodo/.emacs.d`](https://github.com/ocodo/.emacs.d)

Symlink this repo into `~/.emacs.d/local` with:

    ln -s ~/.emacs.local ~/.emacs.d/local

The `init.el` is run after the main `~/.emacs.d/init.el` has finished.

You may also add a `custom.el` which will be used for Emacs Customize settings.
